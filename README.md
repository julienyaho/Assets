#4th Year Project
-I started by creating a scene Level 1 for my game.
-After that I started off by creating a track for my game then i import it in to unity.
-Then i got cars that i was going to use for my game and i also import in.
-I then put in my enemy cars and make sure they come from the other side.
-I make sure every time the main car collid with the enemy car the main car get destroy.
-Also added a pause botton and a score area so that the player will be able to pause the game and be able to see his/her score.
-Then i create and import my menu into Unity and i added other scenes like menu and highscores but i couldn't get the highscores to work
right.
-I added button like Play,Menu,Exit so that when the main car collid the player get an option.
